#"Recursion" -> Recursion is when a method calls itself to solve a smaller part of the same problem.

#Formula we used in calculating Forecast is:-
    futureValue(years) = futureValue(years - 1) * (1 + growthRate)
    Base Case: futureValue(0) = initialAmount

#Time Complexity:
"Recursive calls": one call per year â†’ O(n)
"Space Complexity": O(n) due to call stack
